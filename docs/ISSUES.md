## Issues

* **Incorrect Note Deletion on Rename:**  Renaming a note sometimes deletes the wrong note, especially when only two notes exist.
* **Broken `<leader>d` Keymap:** The keymap for deleting the current note (`<leader>d`) is not functioning correctly.
* **Performance Issues**  The application's performance degrades over time, indicating a potential memory leak.
